# Color-Based Object Detection

This project implements object detection in videos using color-based filtering in the HSV color space. With adjustable HSV color trackbars, users can tune the color range flexibly, making it adaptable to detect objects of varying colors in real-time.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for object detection based on color. Using OpenCV and HSV color space, users can interactively adjust the color thresholds to isolate objects of a particular color in a video stream. This method is useful for detecting objects with unique colors in cluttered environments or for tracking color-specific items in dynamic video footage.

## Features

- **Adjustable HSV Trackbars**: Modify the HSV range in real-time to detect different colors.
- **Real-time Video Processing**: Works with live video feeds or pre-recorded videos.
- **Flexible Color Tuning**: Detect objects by adjusting HSV values, suitable for changing lighting conditions and environments.
